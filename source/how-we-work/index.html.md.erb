<!--- There's an opportunity to combine the norms, values and principles in to one document. The values are similar to the principles, which we could combine. Some of the norms are supporting behaviours for the principles/values. --->

# How we work

### Team charter
These values and principles help guide the way we work, and they make up our [team charter](https://app.mural.co/t/gaap0347/m/gaap0347/1701782726470/3d24c49b03f11adc64d8782e8a2d95cd48ede08c?sender=u6310a9540dc1e48502797576). We've committed to the team charter as a collective, which forms the basis for how we work together.
