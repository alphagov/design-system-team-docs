# Get help from other roles

We're a [multidisciplinary team](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-6-have-a-multidisciplinary-team) made up of people with a diverse mix of skills and expertise. This helps us make better quality decisions that lead to great outcomes for users, as opposed to working in siloes which isolate people from each other based on their role. Great ideas come from [combining different perspectives](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/02/01/professions-and-boldness/).

We can learn from people in other roles by working directly with them on projects. But when this isn't possible, we can still 'knock on their door' and ask for help. 

## Product manager and delivery manager

A delivery manager is accountable for the delivery of products and services.
