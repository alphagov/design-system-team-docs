# What to do when someone joins or leaves the team

There are a series of tasks to complete when someone joins or leaves the team. A delivery manager on the team is responsible for ensuring these tasks are completed. These tasks have been documented internally [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IFJVRj0Qba9QK7GZhVfLQB4TDrEoFBm545RbCrkX5BQ/edit#heading=h.8dwsfyahslqe).
