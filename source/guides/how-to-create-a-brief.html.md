# How to create a brief

In GitHub we used “parent” issues to host our cycle briefs. This creates a hierarchy where we can create sub-issues which form the deliverables of a brief.

In the majority of cases, the brief will already have been created by a team lead. However, there may be occasions when you need to create a brief yourself. This guide explains how.


## Choosing the appropriate GitHub repository to create the brief in

The context of the brief you’re creating will determine the repository you create it in.

- for a brief specific to GOV.UK Frontend, use the [govuk-frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend)
- for a brief which is regarding GOV.UK Prototype Kit, use [govuk-prototype-kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit)
- for a brief specific to the Frontend docs, use [govuk-frontend-docs](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend-docs)
- for a brief regarding the Brand Guidelines website, use [govuk-brand-guidelines](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-brand-guidelines)
- for a brief specific to the team playbook, use [design-system-team-docs](https://github.com/alphagov/design-system-team-docs)

If a brief is sensitive and should not be seen by people outside of the team, use [design-system-team-internal](https://github.com/alphagov/design-system-team-internal). This repository is private and used only by members of the Design System team.

If a brief is specific to the Design System website, use the [govuk-design-system repo](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system). If your brief cannot be categorised by any of the other repos, also use the [govuk-design-system repo](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system).

## Creating a brief

**Step 1:** Navigate to the “Issues” tab.

**Step 2:** Select the green “New issue” button.

**Step 3:** Select the “Cycle brief” template.

**Step 4:** Complete the “## Brief” section which contains a prompt about the content you should include.

**Step 5:** Complete the “## Squad” section by tagging your fellow squad members via their GitHub username.

**Step 6:** Complete the “## Further detail” which contains a prompt about the content you should include.

**Step 7:** Attach “Assignees” to the brief (these are your fellow squad members). This feature may be found either at the bottom of the pop-up window or on the right side-navigation of the issue.

**Step 8:** Add the appropriate labels (guide coming soon).

**Step 9:** Add a “Project” board. In most cases this should be “GOV.UK Design System cycle board”.

**Step 10:** Select the green “Create” button to open your issue.

After the brief has been created, double check it has been set up correctly by reviewing the right side-navigation to check all the appropriate metadata is showing. 

Under the “Projects” sub-section, you may need to update the “Status” field on the “GOV.UK Design System cycle board” to “Backlog”.

There is no need to use the “Type” field at present — you can leave this blank.

Note that your brief will not appear on the [cycle board](https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/projects/53/views/72) until you add a sub-issue. Read the guide [here about creating sub-issues](...).
