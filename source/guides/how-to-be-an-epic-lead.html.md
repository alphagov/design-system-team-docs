# How to be an epic lead on the Design System squad

This guidance is aimed at helping new epic leads on the Design System squad get started in the role. 

## Background info
  
In a previous squad health check the following action was agreed:

> Each epic has a lead who helps move the work at pace and ensures there is effective communication inside and outside the team.

This role was introduced to the Design System squad in 2023.

## What is an epic lead?
  
An epic lead is a pragmatic coordinator and is ideally interested, passionate or an expert in the subject matter.

They are the person assigned to care about seeing the work delivered, and a conduit between delivery manager, product manager and the epic.

To ensure the role is achievable and sustainable, each individual is limited to leading two epics at any one time. 

## What an epic lead is responsible for
  
- Ensures work on the epic remains visible to the team
- Keeps epic work flowing at pace, ensuring the squad are working together 
- Ensures GitHub cards are kept up to date
- Coordinates mid-cycle demos and show & tell updates
- Helps break gridlock when there’s uncertainty or ambiguity
- Escalates issues and blockers to the delivery manager and product manager

## What an epic lead doesn’t do
  
- Make all the decisions
- Be the only person drafting goals or speaking at show & tell
- Replace the delivery manager or product manager

## Working with the delivery manager and product manager

An epic lead will meet with the delivery manager and product manager every three weeks for support in their role.

This meeting can be used for a number of things such as:

- roadmapping next steps
- escalating issues or blockers
- help with decision making
- help with visibility of work
