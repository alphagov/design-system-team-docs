# How we prioritise

This page details what factors we consider when prioritising a roadmap or a cycle.

## Should we do this?

- Does this fit with our [product strategy](https://govuk-design-system-team-docs.netlify.app/what-we-do/future-of-the-govuk-design-system/)?
- Is this something we need to do to keep the product running? (includes activities such as comms, marketing, engagement and securing budget)
- Is this something we need to do to make sure we’re still relevant to our users?
- Is this something we need to do because of external factors?
- Will it help us meet a user need? Is it addressing a long standing pain point?

## Does it have value?

- Will it benefit lots of users and services? Does it save time or help them build better quality services?
- Is it something only our team can or will do? (things that need to be rolled out centrally or need specific skills)
- Will it benefit our team by saving us time or improving the quality of what we do?
- Will it open future opportunities for us or our users?

## Do we have capacity?

- How long will it take?
- Do we have the right skills?
- Are there constraints with any roles?
- Do we have enough information about the problem?

## Prioritising briefs

These are the factors we consider when prioritising briefs in a cycle.

- Is there anything urgent we need to deal with?
- What is the team’s availability? Who is on leave?
- What is carrying over from last cycle? Do we want to continue? Who is working on this?
- Who’s left to work on something new?
- What’s planned on the roadmap?
- What roles are needed on the brief?
- What are people’s preferences?
- Is there enough work? Is it evenly distributed?
