# How to suggest something
This guide details how to suggest various things on the team.

## Epics to the roadmap
_Coming soon_

## Small stories

_Coming soon_

## New GitHub labels

Create a new issue in the [design-system-team-labels repository on GitHub](https://github.com/alphagov/design-system-team-labels). 

Make sure to include:

- the proposed name of the labels
- what it will be used for
- alternatives you have explored for this need (eg GitHub Projects or Milestones)

A team lead or delivery manager will review it.

## Stickers

We usually create stickers on the team to celebrate an achievement, a major milestone or publishing something new.

You can suggest an idea for a sticker, or contribute a design by adding something to [this Padlet board](https://govukdesignsystem.padlet.org/govukdesignsystem/sticker-ideas-lykq5emdey23o3jc).

Once you have added, let a delivery manager know you have done so, and they can kick off the design and / or spend approval process.

## Away day activities

We aim to have an away day every quarter (approximately every 3 months). We host the away days at each GDS office in London, Manchester and Bristol on a rotationary basis.

If you have an idea for a workshop or activity which you think would be better run in-person, add your idea to [this Padlet board](https://govukdesignsystem.padlet.org/govukdesignsystem/activities-for-future-away-days-pkngvimb9gkzl1ld).
