# What we do

We maintain the GOV.UK Design System and related tools.

## Our products

### Actively developed

- [GOV.UK Design System Website] - guidance for making government services consistent with GOV.UK. The code is maintained in the [govuk-design-system GitHub repository].
- [GOV.UK Frontend] - a code library of GOV.UK Design System components.
- [GOV.UK Frontend Docs] - Technical documentation for installing and using GOV.UK Frontend. The code is maintained in the [govuk-frontend-docs GitHub repository].
- [Community backlog] - a backlog of user-submitted component and pattern suggestions for inclusion into the Design System.
- [stylelint-config-gds] - a stylelint configuration for SCSS and CSS files across GDS.

### Maintenance

#### Accessible Autocomplete

The GOV.UK Design System team maintains the [Accessible Autocomplete] as a standalone component. However, we’re only able to put in minimal work to support it.

[Read about our plans to maintain this component](https://github.com/alphagov/accessible-autocomplete/issues/532).

[Read more about the types of support we can provide](https://github.com/alphagov/accessible-autocomplete/issues/430).

#### GOV.UK Prototype Kit

The [GOV.UK Prototype Kit] is currently maintained by the GOV.UK Design System team. Huge thanks to the GOV.UK Prototype team, who’s hard work has made our job of maintaining the Prototype Kit much easier.

We will:

- update dependencies and address serious bugs
- review bugs and dependencies every 3 months (serious bugs will be given high priority)

We cannot:

- provide user support on Slack, GitHub or via email
- add new features
- review contributions
- update documentation
- address smaller functionality issues that do not block usage

Many departments told us about documentation and support for the Prototype Kit which was provided internally, so we encourage users to seek help from their colleagues.
