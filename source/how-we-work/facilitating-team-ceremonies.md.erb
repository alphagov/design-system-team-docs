# How facilitating team ceremonies works
On the GOV.UK Design System, [the team leads and delivery managers](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/design-system-team/) are responsible for facilitating team ceremonies. This is done on a rotational basis, and a delivery manager will update the [rota](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KaUf4gsDqAiwZIp0WW6O9NIx9XgEqOSH1jNbD5DVeTw/edit?gid=1919279220#gid=1919279220). They will then inform individuals of when they’re due to facilitate a ceremony.

You can find more information about [how to run a ceremony here.](https://govuk-design-system-team-docs.netlify.app/guides/how-to-run-a-design-system-team-ceremony-or-workshop/#sprint-planning)

## Preparing for a ceremony
It’s also the responsibility of the facilitator to prepare all materials for the ceremony, and encourage the team to contribute if appropriate e.g. asking the team to add slides for show & tell.
