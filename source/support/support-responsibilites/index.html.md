# Daily support responsibilities

Our support hours are 10am – 4pm, Monday to Friday.

The support rota is in the ‘[Design System team events]’ calendar. If you know you‘re going to be away or busy on your support day, try to find somebody to swap with on the team Slack channel. If you have an unplanned absence, let the team know on Slack and someone will cover.

At the start of your support day, you should update the Slack channels with something like this message:

> “Hello, I’m on support today from 10am to 4pm if you need any help. You can also direct message me or email govuk-design-system-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk.”

You should also change your display name in Slack. 

For example “Kelly Lee - GOV.UK Design System team”. 

This is so it is clear to our users which responses are from the team.

Remember to check Zendesk for any open tickets, especially at the start of the day. There may be tickets that came in at the end of the previous day that need responding to.

If a submission to the [Community Resources] list is made whilst you are on support, it is your responsibility to review the submission against the contribution criteria. You may need to ask the contributor for further information or advise changes to the resource in order to meet the criteria, meaning the review could take longer than your support day. In this occurrence, you will continue to own the review of the submission. Ensure that you add any associated GitHub issues or pull requests to the sprint board.

Whilst on support, it is preferable to pause sprint work and prioritise support tasks.

## Daily check in

At the end of each day you should complete the [daily check in form]. In the absence of logging support requests this will help us measure the impact of providing support.
