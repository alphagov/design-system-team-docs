All designers and developers on the GOV.UK Design System team are on the support rota. The rota is updated monthly.  

# Updating the rota

The Design System team events calendar is used to host the support rota. Most members of the team can add new events to this calendar.

Add an all day event to the calendar stating who is on support. For example:

> Kelly on support

Repeat this for the following month, rotating who is on support each day. Pay attention to non-working days and planned leave when allocating. 

Support is not required on no meetings days.

## Tell the team
  
Let the team know on Slack when you have updated the support rota so individuals can check their days. 

Make a note of when the rota is due to be updated again and add a reminder to the Design System team events calendar.
