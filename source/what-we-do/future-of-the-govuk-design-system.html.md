# Where the GOV.UK Design System is heading

This page details the future strategy of the GOV.UK Design System.

## Vision statements

- We will remain a design system for GOV.UK services, both transactional and non-transactional
- We will support users to make better design decisions and build usable and accessible services
- We won't support custom branding or build an alternate generic brand
- We won’t build components and patterns specifically for internal services
- We will signpost to resources built by other community members
- We will provide better support for users to adapt and extend the GOV.UK Design System
- We will support consistency of the GOV.UK journey across different channels
- We will continue to build “foundational” components and patterns. We won't build every component
- We will influence frontend strategy and policy across government services
- We will help users understand how to use the Design System to prototype
