# Design and content

## Designers on the team

### Charlotte

I trained as a product designer with a bit of engineering but always preferred service design projects. GDS hired me as a motion graphic designer and illustrator, I mainly did slide decks, animations and social media assets. I’m happy to lend my hand to anything, I like to look at things in detail using grids and maths (engineering side) but I struggle with being super creative. I’m more iterative than innovative. 

### Ciandelle

Having had a career in both service and interaction design I take an approach of understanding where my interaction design work fits in from a service design point of view. I feel that it is important to design with the wider picture in mind, reducing the risk of barriers between the work being done and implementation in the wider environment. I make it a point of pride to design in an accessible way, so that no user is left behind. I utilise the prototype kit to make prototypes as it allows me to experience what a user will see. I find physical drawing and graphic design more challenging but have been practicing these skills. 

### Mia

I trained as a graphic designer but since then I’ve done a range of things, including motion graphics, product design, interaction design, illustration, publication design and exhibition design. I can draw you a logo and I can help you refine your brand. Coding in HTML and CSS are fun things I like to do when the need arises, but I’m not up on the latest frameworks. I’m generally tool agnostic, and I will always start from first principles: why does this exist, what are we trying to do, what are the words we’re using? My philosophy is: don’t try to solve a content problem with interaction design. Also, if it’s not accessible, it’s not finished.
