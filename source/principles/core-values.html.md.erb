# Core values

The beliefs and principles of the team.

1. We build good quality, well researched stuff that works for everyone

2. We build in the open, so that people can see what we are doing and why we have done things

3. Stay curious, humble and open to new perspectives

4. Work with and for our peers and community â€” it's a two way relationship

5. We're set up to do the harder work

6. Evidence and research are golden; get it when you can

7. Care for, support and look out for each other
