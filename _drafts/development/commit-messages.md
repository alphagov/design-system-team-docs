# Commit messages

Write the summary line and description of what you have done in the imperative
mode, that is as if you were commanding someone. For example, start the line
with "Fix", "Add" or "Change" instead of "Fixed", "Added" or "Changed".

Limit your commit summary (the first line of the commit) to 50 characters. If
you need to provide more detail (which you often will), leave a blank line and
add a commit description. Each line in your description should wrap at 72
characters.

You should make sure you capture the context and reasoning for the change:

- Why is the change necessary?
- How does the commit address the issue?
- What are the consequences of the change?

You should link to any supporting information:

- relevant guidance, third party documentation or blog posts that informed
  your decision
- Trello cards, GitHub issues or other bug reports

Remember that this supporting information might not be accessible to everyone,
and links can easily be broken, so make sure the important information is
included in the commit message.

You should also refer to the [service manual guidance on commit
messages](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/maintaining-version-control-in-coding#writing-commit-messages).
