When somebody new joins the team, they will need to be given access to our support services. We encourage the entire team to have visibility of support requests, regardless of whether they will be on the support rota.

## Adding to Zendesk

The team uses a tool called Zendesk to manage email requests. 

Before adding the new starter to Zendesk, you should add them to the Google group. Only admins and managers of the group will be able to do this.

Once successfully added, you’ll then need to raise a ticket on Zendesk with '2nd/3rd Line--Zendesk Administration'. Ask for the new starter to be added to the Design System group.

If the new starter will be on the support rota or will likely respond to emails from users, request they are added as a ‘GDS Resolver’. If they are unlikely to need reply access, request they are added as a ‘Light Agent’.

Please note, ‘GDS Resolver’ access is automatically removed if the user does not use it within 6 months.

Once added, they will be able to access support requests received by Zendesk.

## Slack
  
Add the new starter to the Slack support channels listed in [this guide](https://govuk-design-system-team-docs.netlify.app/support/support-channels/#slack).
