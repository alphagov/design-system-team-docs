<!--- There's an opportunity to combine the norms, values and principles in to one document. The values are similar to the principles, which we could combine. Some of the norms are supporting behaviours for the principles/values. --->

# Group norms

These norms are the social contract which underpins our work.

1. Ask for help when you need it. 

2. Don't work if you're not well

3. Share your work

4. Say what you're going to do, do it, say what you did

5. Involve others in decision making

6. Be willing to make a call based on evidence, even if it doesn't feel perfect

7. Invite feedback 

8. Take the time to say thank you
