# How to seek approval for travel
Due to the current limited travel budget in 2023/24, all travel needs to be approved by the senior leadership team (SMT) before booking.

The team leads can help you seek approval for travel related to your work on the team. Travel for any other reason, for example attending a conference, will need to be approved via your community or line manager. 

If you wish to book travel, please send the following information to the team leads:

- reason for travel
- why in-person is more appropriate than remote
- estimated cost of trip (transport, accommodation and subsistence)

The team leads will liaise with SMT to seek approval and inform you when a decision has been made.
