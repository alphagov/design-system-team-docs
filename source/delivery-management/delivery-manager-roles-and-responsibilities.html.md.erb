# Delivery manager roles and responsibilities
This guide documents responsibilities of the various delivery managers we have on the GOV.UK Design System team.

- working closely with subject matter experts in squads to facilitate decision making and unblock issues which impede delivery 
- organising facilitation of team ceremonies, and updating rotas
- management of team health, values and norms through regular one-to-ones with team members
- ensuring work is visible, tracked and up to date on tools such as GitHub Projects and Jira
- managing team leave, sickness and availability
- purchasing and billing of tooling and infrastructure
