# Products we support

## Current products

- [GOV.UK Design System website]
- [GOV.UK Frontend] – 4.x (until at least December 2024) and 5.x
- [Community backlog]

## Legacy products

We no longer support the following retired "legacy" products, which GOV.UK Frontend and GOV.UK Design System replaced:

- [GOV.UK Elements]
- [GOV.UK Frontend Toolkit]
- [GOV.UK Template]

However, we do support users who need to [migrate from these products to GOV.UK Frontend](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/v4/migrating-from-legacy-products/#migrate-one-component-at-a-time).

## No longer supported

### [GOV.UK Prototype Kit]

The [GOV.UK Prototype Kit] is currently maintained by the GOV.UK Design System team. Huge thanks to the GOV.UK Prototype team, who’s hard work has made our job of maintaining the Prototype Kit much easier.

We will:

- update dependencies and address serious bugs
- review bugs and dependencies every 3 months (serious bugs will be given high priority)

We cannot:

- provide user support on Slack, GitHub or via email
- add new features
- review contributions
- update documentation
- address smaller functionality issues that do not block usage

Many departments told us about documentation and support for the Prototype Kit which was provided internally, so we encourage users to seek help from their colleagues.

### [Accessible Autocomplete]

The GOV.UK Design System team maintains the [Accessible Autocomplete] as a standalone component. However, we’re only able to put in minimal work to support it.

[Read about our plans to maintain this component](https://github.com/alphagov/accessible-autocomplete/issues/532).
