# Delivery manager roles and responsibilities
This guide documents responsibilities of the various delivery managers we have on the GOV.UK Design System team.

## Delivery manager / associate delivery manager
The delivery manager(s) will be accountable for the day to day delivery of squad work on the team. In a cycle it’s possible they could work on 1-3 squads, depending on priorities. 

Responsibilities include:

- acting as a conduit between the squads and Design System leadership, reporting on delivery progress, escalating risks and issues, and challenging delivery timeframes and expectations when necessary
- determining most appropriate ways of working and delivery methods for each squad you’re working with
- working closely with subject matter experts in squads to facilitate decision making and unblock issues which impede delivery 
- organising facilitation of team ceremonies, and updating rotas
- management of team health, values and norms through regular one-to-ones with team members
- ensuring work is visible, tracked and up to date on tools such as GitHub Projects and Jira
- managing team leave, sickness and availability
- purchasing and billing of tooling and infrastructure 
- ownership of the team playbook
- onboarding / offboarding of team members

## Lead delivery manager

The lead delivery manager is responsible for managing delivery expectations external to the team, and providing support to the delivery manager working with squads.

- support the development of product strategy and benefits case
- build a roadmap to deliver product strategy
- determine cycle briefs (in collaboration with other team leads)
- risk management and escalation external to the team, and management of stakeholder expectations
- governance and reporting to senior leadership
- recruitment and contractor management
- support, consultation and coaching of other delivery managers on the team
