# Principles

These principles guide us in working on the design system. They’re designed to inspire action, help us make decisions and set boundaries. We rely on principles rather than process.

## 1. Be open

Be transparent about our processes and the decisions we make. Take on feedback and change our work or our ideas.

## 2. Be inviting

Actively encourage members of the team, people at GDS, and the wider community to get involved in our work and help shape decisions.

## 3. Transfer power

Enable others to make decisions about the design system. Seek out people and ideas proactively that we can involve in activities.

## 4. Educate

Provide people with the knowledge and skills to iterate and improve the design system sustainably.

## 5. Progress, don’t perfect

Focus on validating the riskiest assumptions. Highlight where the cost of being wrong is low. Trust the community’s insights to guide us. Iterate.

## 6. Don’t skip the basics

We create things of value that are usable, accessible, consistent and versatile. We look after the team’s health. We produce high-quality work and document it for our users.

## 7. Expect a bumpy road

It’s okay to make a call that turned out to be wrong. That’s how we learn and improve. 

## 8. Lift each other up

Own our team and its ceremonies collectively. Create a safe and empathetic environment for each other, facilitators and contributors both. Give or ask for help.
