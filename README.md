# GOV.UK Design System Team Docs

A reference guide for who we are and the way we do things. It's a playbook for anyone in the GOV.UK Design System team that tells us the 'right way' to do things.

What's written here is the way we do things now, but that will change from time to time.

## Technologies

The docs were built using the [Tech Docs Template](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template), which uses [Tech Docs Gem version 3.3.1](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem/releases/tag/v3.3.1).

## Contributing

Contributions from the team are always welcome! This playbook is currently in alpha, meaning we're testing out what content and guidance is useful. Raising issues and pull requests is strongly encouraged, so that we can develop the playbook as a team.

We continually update this playbook because we're always looking for better ways to get things done. And that changes over time, especially as who works on the team and what we work on changes too.

See [`contributing.md`](contributing.md) for ways to get started.
