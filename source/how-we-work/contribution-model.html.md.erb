# Contribution model

The GOV.UK Design System was originally built on a culture of cross-government collaboration, and since early on the Design System has been [open to contributions](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2018/09/26/opening-up-the-gov-uk-design-system-for-contributions/). Over the years we've learned a lot about how to make this work well, and we [iterated the contribution model](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2023/05/31/iterating-the-gov-uk-design-system-contribution-model/) in 2023. 

This forms the basis of our product operating model: how we combine experience and perspectives from across government to deliver a useful, usable, consistent and versatile design system for service teams across government.

> There is no one-size-fits-all process for how we work. The contribution model is process agnostic, and there are many processes that could happen to create value at different stages of the model.

You can see the model and the activities we do at each stage [in a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jSGZWy2IO0cZvyggyaa5pz2-6L5bPg7FXXxbJZbTDjA/edit#gid=0) or watch the video that describes the model. The model shows team members what stages we work through, who does what at each stage, and what's expected of them.

## Roles and responsibilities

We work in a multidisciplinary way. Many people contribute to the work happening across the stages of the contribution model, but some people have a clear role and responsibility to drive things forward. We also rely on each other to provide the necessary inputs at each stage.

For example, a designer will consolidate multiple designs to define a versatile style, component or pattern. Designers need evidence as source material for that, which they may get from the user researcher. 

When not playing a driving role, people play either 
- a supporting role, contributing to work at this stage, or 
- need awareness of what's happening, so they can have input later.
