### Setting up a cycle
The delivery manager will be responsible for:
- reviewing the cycle brief written by the team leads and ensuring yourself and the entire squad understands the problem or goal, working closely with product managers manage scope
- ensuring sub-issues are written and attached to the brief on GitHub (either by writing them, pair writing or delegating to a squad member)
- establish clear ownership of work between squad members, to prevent silos and misunderstandings
- deciding on the best method of delivery for the squad make up and context in any given cycle, including deciding the frequency of ceremonies, and how work is sequenced
- modelling good GitHub hygiene and making sure the squad to visualise their work through fully completed issue descriptions, accurate done whens, labels, milestones and other tracking mechanisms available

### Delivering the work
The delivery manager will be responsible for:
- making sure the squad is working on the deliverables of the brief, maintaining focus and avoiding unplanned work or scope creep
- applying healthy pressure to ensure squads are working to meet a deadline
- identifying and resolving blockers and issues such as decision making, uncertainty over priorities, and arranging review / input from specific disciplines
- seeking and providing clarity when there is uncertainty
- monitoring risks to delivery and applying mitigations ahead of a risk materialising, escalating to the Lead Delivery Manager if it cannot be resolved within the team  
- ensuring all decisions which can be resolved by a squad are before a cycle ends, and ensuring the resulting actions are recorded in GitHub

### Wrapping up a cycle
The delivery manager will be responsible for:
- closing completed briefs and sub-issues when a cycle is complete, and transferring any outstanding issues to a new brief or creating a small story 
- communicating to the Lead Delivery Manager what has been delivered at the end of a cycle, and what needs to carry over
- following up on pain points expressed in retrospectives, driving iterations to ways of working
