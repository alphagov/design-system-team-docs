# How to use GitHub to visualise your work
The GOV.UK Design System team uses GitHub Projects to manage our workflow. GitHub Projects allows the team to work in the open and encourages contribution to the code base and guidance from users. 

This guide will include a series of videos explaining how to complete various tasks on GitHub to ensure your work is visualised.
